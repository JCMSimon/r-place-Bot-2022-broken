# r/place Bot [BANNING]
A in theory working Bot that unfortunately gets detected *in some way* and just gets you banned (probally).

None the less i learned stuff especially about Selenium in combination with shadow root's
And also how to integrate proxies into Selenium. :D

Anyways, this is it for me. Good luck to everyone else!
